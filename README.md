processDvd : a small piece of code that turns any x11 window into a dvd logo

KNOWN ISSUES :
crashes when closing dvd-ed window
10 window limit
overall lack of code quality
band aid fix that is the 60hz limit
comments are in french, sorry (tbh they are worthless either way)



HOW DO I USE IT ??

launch the code;
select any window.
press f12
?????
dvd logo

DOESN'T WORK ??

1 : my code is hit
2 : your wm is probably angery
3 : if you use a tiling wm you need to put the window into floating mode (mod+shift+space default for i3wm for example)
4 : my code is still shit
5 : max 10 windows until i figure out a better array






yes this is useless, yes this is my first C project.
