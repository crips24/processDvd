### KNOWN ISSUES :

 - crashes when closing dvd-ed window
 - 10 window limit 
 - overall lack of code quality
 - band aid fix that is the 60hz limit
 - comments are in french, sorry (tbh they are worthless either way)

<br>


### HOW DO I USE IT ??

 - launch the code;
 - select any window. 
 - press f12 
 - ?????
 - bouncing window

<br>
### DOESN'T WORK ??
<ol>
<li>my code is shit </li>
<li>your wm is probably angery</li>
<li>if you use a tiling wm you need to put the window into floating mode (mod+shift+space default for i3wm for example)</li>
<li>my code is still shit</li>
<li>max 10 windows until i figure out a better array</li>
</ol>
